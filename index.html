    <h1>Privacy Policy for PocketRecipe</h1>
    <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 28th July, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Simple Truth: We Don't Collect Your Data</h2>
    <p>PocketRecipe is designed with your privacy as a fundamental principle. We don't collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or recipe data.</p>
    
    <h2>What Data We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We don't collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personal identifiers.</p>
    <p><strong>Recipe Data:</strong> Your recipes, ingredients, meal plans, and shopping lists remain entirely on your device. We never see, access, or store this information.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We don't track how you use the app, which features you access, or how often you open PocketRecipe.</p>
    <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We don't collect device identifiers, IP addresses, or technical information about your iPhone or iPad.</p>
    <p><strong>Location Data:</strong> PocketRecipe doesn't request or use your location information.</p>
    
    <h2>How Your Data Works</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All your recipes and data are stored locally on your device using iOS's built-in data storage systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Import/Export:</strong> When you import or export recipes, the data transfers directly between your device and your chosen destination (email, files app, etc.). We're not involved in this process.</p>
    <p><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> If you choose to enable iCloud sync (if available), your data syncs directly between your devices through Apple's iCloud service. We don't have access to this data - it's handled entirely by Apple's systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>PocketRecipe doesn't integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app functions entirely offline and doesn't communicate with external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect any data, PocketRecipe is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your data's security comes from the fact that it never leaves your control. It's protected by iOS's built-in security features and your device's passcode/biometric locks.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect data, this policy is unlikely to change. If we ever modify PocketRecipe to include any data collection (which we don't plan to do), we'll update this policy and notify users through an app update.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at daraghbeeston@icloud.com.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing for us to delete, modify, or provide access to. Your data belongs entirely to you and remains on your device.</p>
    
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> PocketRecipe works like a traditional recipe box - everything stays with you. We built it this way on purpose because your recipes are personal, and we believe they should stay that way.</p>
